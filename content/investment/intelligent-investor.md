## Chapter 5. The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks

### Rules for the Common-Stock Component

1. There should be adequate though not excessive diversification. This might mean a minimum of ten different issues and a maximum of about thirty.

2. Each company selected should be large, prominent, and conservatively financed.

3. Each company should have a long record of continuous dividend payments.

4. The investor should impose some limit on the price he will pay for an issue in relation to its average earnings over, say, the past seven years. We suggest that this limit be set at 25 times such average earnings, and not more than 20 times those of the last twelve-month period.


## Chapter 7. Portfolio policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side

### Operations in Common Stocks

1. Buying in low markets and selling in high markets
2. Buying carefully chosen "growth stocks"
3. Buying bargain issues of various types
4. Buying into "special situations"
